## About ##
A series of data structures and algorithms written in C++. I do this out of a passion for programming and increasing my proficiency with C++. This is a work in progress and will be a growing repository containing several (unrelated at times) generic algorithms and data structures. 

## Code Format ##
Due to my passion for generic programming, I have implemented most of my algorithms and data structures as template classes/functions. Therefore, you will find most of the code in the include (i.e. .hpp files) directory. When possible, a function definition is moved into the .cpp file. Although it is possible to move template class implementations into the .cpp file, I find it too confusing. 

## Tests ##
Testing is performed using the Google Test framework
