## About ##
A series of data structures and algorithms written in C++. Due to my passion for generic programming, I have implemented most of my algorithms and data structures as template classes/functions. Therefore, you will find most of the code in the include (i.e. .hpp files) directory. When possible, a function definition is moved into the .cpp file. Although it is possible to move template class implementations into the .cpp file, I find it too confusing. 

## Tests ##
Testing is performed using the Google Test framework
